Almost one hundred new shows per year are being released and more than three hundred and fifty are still broadcasting. Among them, productions with a historical strand stand out both on TV and online channels. Peaky Blinders (2013- ) is one of such TV series, which portraits the history of a gangster family in the 1920's. The show is categorized as historical fiction and claims to have based its plot on the real Peaky Blinders gang which was active mainly in Birmingham from the 1890's to 1930. And in the past few years television serial narratives have gone through some severe changes in the way they are organized from a narrative point of view, as well as in the way they are perceived by the audiences(<a href="https://ojs.unica.it/index.php/between/article/view/4">Innocenti and Pescatore, 2015).</a></p>
            
                <p>Peaky Blinders is a British TV series that has been released since 2013 and has captured the attention of not only local but also international audiences, which have stroke fear into the hearts of those living in the slums of post-WWI Birmingham on the cusp of the 1920s. At the same time, this also has proved a very successful BBC Drama. It has been praised both stylistically and for its excellent writing, with one critic describing it as “the most intelligent, stylish and engrossing BBC drama in ages” (<a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/peaky-blinders-episode-1-review/">French, 2013</a>). </p>

                    <p>In the period of last two decades, a dramatic shift in the production and distribution strategies of TV series has occurred gradually on a global scale, as for TV series, transmedia depiction has to be dept a good understanding within the framework of the changes produced by Internet and digital platforms in the media and communicated context(Combes and Glevarec, 2020). The traditional television and, with it, the shows which were introduced in the form of soap operas (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0163443720977277?casa_token=qyFXEvDTk1cAAAAA%3AWw8EWMkP-AKzAfpZ3jd44_qqgEQdJbwaswtRz3Kq8fFHc2FikRHKs-YtDy4Z2XjfG1w8HKyheQw">Piñón, 2019</a>) have been forced to redefine their nature, triggered by technological changes. The TV series show stories that become situated storytelling, the meanings of which are generated in specific contexts such as social media. The social situation of those who are watching this TV series, impacts viewing and mobilizes the significances which are specified into multiple representations. These may be expressed through discourse (Fiske, 1987; Hall, 1997). </p>

                    <p>Recent serial crime dramas such as La casa de papel, Suburra, and Peaky Blinders, which have abandoned the classic formula of European crime TV series, usually focused on the figure of the detective and primarily addressed to a national audience, designed for an international market, these series provocatively concentrate on the figure of the criminal and adopt an explicitly sensationalist approach and this style and the bleak depiction of European society in these series are both an expression and a critical representation of the rise of populism across the Old Continent (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-review/article/abs/images-of-the-european-crisis-populism-and-contemporary-crime-tv-series/8B4F1C1FEC7E6AD98C38E7DC6F26E159">Pagello, F. 2021</a>).</p>

                <p> Tommy Shelby, as head of the family, becomes a focal point and representative for many characters in various scenarios throughout the series. Because of stronger effects around the character of Tommy Shelby about previous TV series, the top seven hashtags of the most correlated Peaky Blinders are Cillian murphy, Tommy shelby, thomas shelby, tvtime, TvChoiceAwards, PeakyBlindersS5, Netflix, TomHardy, which illustrates the actor named by Cillian murphy plays a crucial role in characterizing Tommy Shelby with Peaky Blinder, the character is widely followed both outside and inside the theatre by many big fans who have an extraordinary appreciation for the action of the character, for example, the Tommy Shelby haircut has become sort of a phenomenon in young men’s fashion over the past couple of years and every young guy wants to have hair like Tommy Shelby, It’s arguable that no TV character has influenced the world of hair this much since Rachel Green and Tommy’s haircut has become iconic and fashionable (Sherlock, 2018). And I search <b>"#Peaky Blinders"</b> in TAGS as i believe this term will cover all tweets. From 23 December 2021 to 1 January 2022, there were both<b> 9958 tweets </b> and <b>5051 retweets</b> produced, and half of tweets are reposted correlated texts of Peaky Blinders directly. However, the strange phenomena were that <b> no tweeter have own geo_coordinates on twitter and 6682 tweets have profiles with location </b> that to some extent is unapparent, which may be taken 74.6% of tweeters.</p>

          <dt><b>Secondly</b></dt>
          <dd>some statistic like location,language and the amount of retweets may give Ux designers a apparent thinking, which means these elements will help to analyse
